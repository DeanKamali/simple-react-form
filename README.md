# React Form

Easy to use react forms

Made for Meteor, but works without it too.

This was inspired by aldeed:autoform.


### Installation

Install the base and the material-ui packages

```sh
npm install --save simple-react-form simple-react-form-material-ui
```

Register the material-ui components, just once.

```js
import 'simple-react-form-material-ui';
```

Go to the [docs](https://github.com/nicolaslopezj/simple-react-form/tree/master/docs) folder to continue.
