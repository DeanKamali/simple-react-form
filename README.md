# React Form

Easy to use react forms

Made for Meteor, but works without it too.

This was inspired by aldeed:autoform.


### Installation

```sh
npm install --save simple-react-form
```

Install the material ui package

```sh
npm install --save simple-react-form-material-ui
```

Register the material-ui components, just once.

```

Go to the docs folder to continue.
